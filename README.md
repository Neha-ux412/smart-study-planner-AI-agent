📚 Smart Study Planner – AI Powered Study Scheduler
🚀 Project Overview

Smart Study Planner is a full-stack web application that intelligently generates a personalised study plan based on:

Number of days until exam

Subjects selected

Difficulty level of each subject

Available study hours per day

The system uses a weighted allocation algorithm to distribute study hours proportionally and reserves the final day for revision.
